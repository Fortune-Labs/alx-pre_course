My first directory - 0x01-git

Amazing, I practiced how to create git repos,both uptream and local. I learn how to create directories and files in repossitories,edit files, add them, and commit. Also, I can now create new branches, switch or checkout to them, write code, and push code to branches origin for remote tracking. I can also, merge other branches woht master branch for deployment.
